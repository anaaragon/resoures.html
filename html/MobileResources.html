                The Android platform supports three broad categories of sensors:

                Motion sensors
                These sensors measure acceleration forces and rotational forces in three axes. This category includes accelerometers, gravity sensors, gyroscopes, and rotation vector sensors.

                Environmental sensors
                These sensors measure various environmental parameters, such as ambient air pressure and temperature, lighting, and humidity. This category includes barometers, photometers, and thermometers.

                Position sensors
                These sensors measure the physical position of a device. This category includes orientation sensors and magnetometers.<br />

                <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a><br />
                Flutter is a framework for developing applications for different platforms developed by Google and published for the first time as an open source project in late 2018.
                This development kit offers a large number of libraries for standard elements of the Android and iOS user interface, but it can also be used to develop desktop web applications.
                Applications developed with Flutter have the normal appearance of applications on each system and behave as expected on all of them without the programmers having to pay attention to the particularities of each system.

                 This website can be of great support for app developers, since it has complete explanations of HTML and CSS, which will help to reinforce knowledge and a better design of the application.

                 <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a><br />
                 This tool allows us to validate the HTML markup language.

                 Validation can be done from the URL of the page that we want to validate or by downloading the file to validate from our computer.

                 After validation, the tool shows a list of the lines of the HTML code that do not comply with the standard (as long as this option has been previously selected from 'More options'), together with a description of the problem.

                 In some errors, it also adds an explanation of the possible cause, which can help to solve the error. (as long as this option has been previously selected from 'More options')

                 Among the advanced validation options, there is the possibility of selecting the character set and the type of document used in the page to be validated (in case it is not expressed in the first line of the same).

                 The objective of using this tool -for the tester- is to verify and validate the quality of the HTML code.
